# Learning Composition API

This project is to put in practice all concepts that I learned in the course.

- Composition API

## Learned concepts

- refs: Is used by Vue to react to properties changes also called reactive properties.
- For objects you have to return the entire object. Vue can't detect changes in the object.
- reactive: Is used by Vue to react to properties changes also called reactive properties. But only works with objects.
- Other functions utilities are isRef and isReactive. To check if a property is reactive or not.
- Other important is toRefs. To convert an object to a ref object.
- computed: Is used by Vue when you want to calculate a property based on other properties
- watch: Is used by Vue to react to changes in a property
